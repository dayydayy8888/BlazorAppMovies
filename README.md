This project is a Blazor .NET 8 application built to deliver a personalized and engaging experience for users. 
It features a robust authentication system that allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts securely.
Once authenticated, users can create, view, and manage their own personalized movie lists, tailored to their unique preferences.
The application leverages the power of Entity Framework Core to handle data persistence and includes database migrations to ensure a 
structured and scalable database schema. These migrations make it easier to evolve the database as the application grows, ensuring seamless
updates without disrupting the user experience. Blazor's server-side architecture is utilized to deliver a fast and responsive user interface,
offering smooth navigation and dynamic interactions. This application is a great foundation for projects that aim to combine modern web technologies with scalable backend solutions.
Future improvements could include features such as movie recommendations based on user preferences, social sharing of movie lists, or integration with third-party 
APIs for fetching movie details and reviews.
